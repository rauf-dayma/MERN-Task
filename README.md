# Email Marketing Flowchart Application

This project is a **MERN stack application** for creating and managing email marketing sequences using a visual flowchart interface. The application allows users to design sequences with nodes representing Cold Emails, Wait/Delay, and Lead Sources. It provides a user-friendly interface to connect nodes, manage data, and integrate sequences with email marketing systems.

## Features

### Core Functionalities
| **Feature**               | **Description**                                                                                   |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Flowchart Interface**   | Visual interface to design email marketing sequences using nodes and edges.                       |
| **Add Nodes**             | Add nodes to represent **Cold Email**, **Wait/Delay**, and **Lead Source** in the sequence.       |
| **Edit Nodes**            | Modify the content of nodes directly from the interface.                                          |
| **Delete Nodes**          | Remove any node along with its connected edges.                                                   |
| **Add Connections**       | Connect nodes using edges to define the sequence flow.                                           |
| **Custom Node Types**     | Includes `leadSource`, `startPoint`, `iconOnlyNode`, and `customNode` for various functionalities. |
| **Responsive Design**     | Optimized for different screen sizes to ensure usability on all devices.                          |

### Node-Specific Features
| **Node Type**             | **Description**                                                                                   |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Lead Source Node**      | Represents the source of leads to be added to the sequence.                                       |
| **Start Point Node**      | Marks the starting point of the email sequence.                                                   |
| **Icon-Only Node**        | Provides placeholder or action buttons like `+` for adding steps.                                 |
| **Custom Node**           | Includes a delete button (`üóëÔ∏è`) for removing nodes and handles for connecting to other nodes.      |

### Additional Features
- **Save & Schedule**: Save your flowchart design for scheduling email sequences.
- **Real-Time Node and Edge Updates**: Seamless UI updates on adding, editing, or deleting nodes and edges.
- **Interactive Modals**: Additional details or configurations handled via modals.
